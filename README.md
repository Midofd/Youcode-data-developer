The GitHub Data Scraping project is a data-driven initiative aimed at gaining valuable
insights into the code repositories hosted on GitHub. By analysing the data
from GitHub repositories, we can better understand development trends, identify the most
popular programming languages, discover interesting projects, track repository statistics,
and explore potential opportunities for collaboration.
The project utilises web scraping techniques to collect relevant information from GitHub.
Web scraping involves extracting data from websites by parsing the HTML content of web
pages also by using Github RESTFUL API.
